    // This file does all the work, reads the input data,

    /* Test scores are weighed.
       4 Quizzes: 40% (10% each)
       Midterm 1: 20%
       Midterm 2: 15%
       Final: 25%

       Need to apply weight for each score in the program to calculate the final score.

        Final Score: quiz1*.10 + quiz2*.10 + quiz3*.10 + quiz4*.10 +
                    mid1*.20 + mid2*.15 + final*.25

        Determination of grade:
                    >=90% = A
                    80-89% = B
                    70-79% = C
                    60-69% = D
                    <=59% = F
    */
